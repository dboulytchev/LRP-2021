-- Unit propagation. Takes a formula and returns a pair of reduced formula and partial assignment
-- (a set of chosen literals).
-- If there a unit clause (i.e. a clause containing a single literal, say, l) choose this literal
-- and propagate the choice through the rest of the formula: if there is a clause containing l,
-- remove this clause completely (since it is satisfied by the choice of l); if a clause
-- contains ~l, remove all the occurencies of ~l in this clause (since ~l is set to false by the
-- choice of l). Note: unit propagation should be iterated until a fixpoint since a propagation
-- w.r.t. one literal can open the possibilities for unit propagations w.r.t. another. Note also,
-- unit propagation can result in an inconsistent assignment which has to be detected and
-- handled properly by throwing the UnSat exception.
